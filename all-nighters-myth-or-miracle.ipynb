        "\n",
        "In Phase 2, exploratory data analysis and a baseline linear regression model were used to examine the relationship between sleep quality, academic stress, and academic performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploratory analysis revealed that academic performance was heavily skewed toward lower categories, and both sleep quality and stress levels showed substantial overlap across performance groups. Median-based analysis indicated weak separation, suggesting that neither sleep quality nor stress alone strongly differentiates students by academic outcomes. Boxplots further confirmed this overlap, highlighting high variability within each category.\n",
        "\n",
        "A baseline linear regression model trained using sleep quality and stress levels achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 0.6, indicating that predictions were, on average, within about half a performance category. However, the model produced a low R² value (~0.065), meaning that these features together explain only a small portion of the variance in academic performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results suggest that sleep quality and academic stress are weak but non-negligible contributors to academic performance. While they show some association with outcomes, they are insufficient as standalone predictors, and a substantial amount of performance variability is likely driven by unobserved factors such as study habits, prior academic background, motivation, and instructional quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, Phase 2 demonstrates that sleep and stress alone do not strongly predict academic performance, reinforcing the importance of considering a broader set of academic and behavioral variables in predictive modeling.\n",
